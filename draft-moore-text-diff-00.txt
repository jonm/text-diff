                        The text/diff Media Type
                        draft-moore-text-diff-00

Abstract

   The "unified diff format" is commonly used to represent changes from
   one version of a file to another or to represent a comparison of two
   files.  This document captures the definition of the unified diff
   format as the text/diff media type for the purpose of registering
   this format formally in the IANA standards tree for media types.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The "unified diff format" is a commonly-used file format typically
   used for exchanging patch changesets to a set of documents--most
   notably, source code trees--or for comparing the contents of two
   distinct files.  This format is generated and understood by a variety
   of open source tools including diff, patch, svn, and git.  However,
   at the time of this writing, no definitive, formal definition of this
   file format exists, although there are numerous informal definitions,
   including a Wikipedia article about diff [WIKIPEDIA], a blog post
   [VANROSSUM] by Guido van Rossum, and the documentation for GNU
   diffutils [GNU].

   At the same time, the HTTP PATCH method has been standardized as RFC
   5789 [RFC5789], for which this file format would be an ideal media
   type.  There are additionally other Internet-based services that
   trade regularly in patches or diffs that might benefit specifically
   from having participants explicitly declare that exchanged patchsets
   conform to a specific file format.

   Therefore, the goals of this document are first, to record a formal
   definition of the file format for reference purposes, and second, to
   request the IANA registration of a standard media type for this
   format.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Definition

   As a member of the "text/*" media type family, the text/diff format
   follows the requirements for textual messages laid out in RFC 2046
   [RFC2046], including the use of a "charset" parameter with a default
   value of US-ASCII and the use of CRLF as a linebreak.

2.1.  Permitted Character Sets

   The unified diff format relies on the use of certain US-ASCII
   characters to delineate change hunks and context.  Therefore, the
   value of the "charset" parameter MUST reference a character set which
   is a superset of US-ASCII.  Permitted character sets specifically
   include:

   o  US-ASCII

   o  those in the ISO-8859-* family

   o  UTF-8

   Other character sets that are supersets of US-ASCII MAY be specified
   as values of the "charset" parameter.  If the parameter is omitted
   then a default value of US-ASCII MAY be assumed.

   Generally speaking, this format is useful for describing changesets
   against files whose original and modified character set encodings are
   both supersets of US-ASCII.  Implementations generating text/diff
   SHOULD follow the guidelines of RFC 2046 [RFC2046] and use the
   "lowest common denominator" for the "charset" parameter value.  For
   example, it is possible that the original and modified versions of a
   file might use the ISO-8859-1 character set, but the changed portions
   only use US-ASCII characters: in this case the resulting diff should
   be marked as using the "us-ascii" character set.  An implementation
   MUST NOT include characters in a text/diff file that are not
   compatible with the value of the "charset" parameter.

   The requirement to have a single character set for a text/diff file
   means that there are certain change operations this format cannot
   express, for example the conversion of a file from ISO-8859-1 to
   UTF-8 where non-US-ASCII characters are used in both the old and new
   versions.  In particular, this means that not all output of the
   common UN*X diff utility--even when generating the unified diff
   format--will be a valid text/diff file.  This media type is aimed
   instead at the very common case where the character sets of the old
   and new file are compatible with these requirements and can thus be
   treated as a text/* type.

2.2.  Grammar

   Formal syntax in this document is governed by the ABNF (Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form) notation [RFC5234], including the following core
   ABNF syntax rules defined by that specification: DIGIT (decimal
   digits), HTAB (horizontal tab), SP (space), CR (carriage return), and
   LF (linefeed).  This syntax also incorporates by reference the "URI-
   reference" ABNF production from RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

   A diff file begins with a two-line header describing the old and new
   filenames and their modification dates, and a way of differentiating
   which is the old and which is the new.

   year = 4DIGIT
   month = 2DIGIT
   day = 2DIGIT
   date = year "-" month "-" day
   hour = 2DIGIT
   minute = 2DIGIT
   second = 2DIGIT
   nanosecond = 9DIGIT
   time = hour ":" minute ":" second [ "." nanosecond ]
   timezone = ("+" / "-") hour minute
   resource-modification = URI-reference HTAB date SP time SP timezone
   old-indicator = "---"
   new-indicator = "+++"
   old-header = old-indicator SP resource-modification
   new-header = new-indicator SP resource-modification
   headers = old-header CRLF new-header CRLF


   After the header, a diff file contains a set of chunks.  Each chunk
   begins with a header identifying the relevant selection of lines from
   the old and new files.


   line-number = 1*DIGIT
   range = line-number [ "," line-number ]
   chunk-header = "@@" SP "-" range SP "+" range SP "@@"


   After the chunk header, the chunk includes a set of lines that are
   marked as being either common, only in the old file, or only in the
   new file.


   common = SP
   old-only = "-"
   new-only = "+"
   line-affinity = common / old-only / new-only
   non-linebreak = %x00-09 / %x0B-0C / %x0E-FF
   non-linefeed = %x00-09 / %x0B-FF
   content = non-linebreak / (CR non-linefeed)
   chunk-line = line-affinity 1*content CRLF


   Thus, a chunk consists of a chunk header followed by at least one
   chunk line.


   chunk = chunk-header CRLF 1*chunk-line

   Therefore, a single file diff is a header followed by at least one
   chunk.


   diff = headers 1*chunk


   And lastly, a patch consists of a non-empty set of single file diffs.
   A file matching the "patch" production is a valid text/diff file.


   patch = 1*diff



3.  Security Considerations

3.1.  Out-of-scope attacks

   Since this document describes a media type and not a protocol,
   network-based attacks are out of scope for this specification.  In
   particular, eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion,
   modification, and man-in-the-middle attacks are the concern of the
   containing or transporting protocol and not of the media type itself.
   This specification makes no claims about and does not provide
   facilities for authentication, authorization, file integrity, or non-
   repudiation.

3.2.  In-scope attacks

   As a subtype of the "text/*" media type, text/diff shares many of the
   security concerns related to processing any arbitrary text body.  In
   particular, implementators SHOULD be aware that this specification
   does not impose a maximum line length, and that implementations that
   assume a fixed maximum line length may be subject to buffer overrun
   attacks.  Implementations should also be aware of denial-of-service
   or buffer overrun attacks involving extraordinarily large text/diff
   files.  Again, however, file framing would be a concern of the
   containing or transporting protocol.

   In addition, text/diff files may contain control characters that may
   alter an operating environment when displayed to a terminal (or
   otherwise).  RFC 3023 [RFC3023] contains a list of possible attacks
   and recommended defenses against these attacks in its Security
   Considerations section.

   The contents of a text/diff file describe a set of changes that may
   be applied to a file to alter its contents, and hence implementations

   that process text/diff patches SHOULD be sure that the sender is
   properly authenticated and authorized before applying patches.  To
   the extent that patches are automatically applied, recipients of
   text/diff entities may be at risk.  In general, it may be possible to
   specify changesets that perform unauthorized file changes and/or make
   changes to the recipient's system that may affect subsequent
   processing.

   Some security considerations will vary by application domain.  For
   example, text/diff patches intended to update financial records may
   have more stringent privacy, security, and auditing requirements than
   a publicly-disseminated file showing the source code differences
   between two releases of an open source software project.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA to register the text/diff media
   type.

   Type name: text

   Subtype name: diff

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters:

      charset

         This parameter has identical semantics to the "charset"
         parameter of the "text/plain" media type as specified in RFC
         2046 [RFC2046].  Values are restricted to charsets which are
         supersets of US-ASCII.

   Encoding considerations:

      The syntax of the text/diff format is expressed over 8-bit octets.
      The encoding of the file is as specified by the charset parameter,
      which defaults to US-ASCII if not provided.

   Security considerations: see Section 3.

   Interoperability considerations: TBD

   Published specification: this document.

   Applications that use this media type: diff, patch, svn, git.
