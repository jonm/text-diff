                        The text/diff Media Type
                        draft-moore-text-diff-00

Abstract

   This document captures the definition of the commonly-used "unified
   diff format" used to represent changes from one version of a file to
   another for the purpose of registering this format formally as a
   registered IANA media type.

1.  Introduction

   The "unified diff format" is a commonly-used file format typically
   used for exchanging patch changesets to a set of documents--most
   notably, source code trees. (including source code).  This format is
   generated and understood by a variety of open source tools including
   diff, patch, svn, and git.  However, at the time of this writing, no
   definitive, formal definition of this file format exists, although
   there are numerous informal definitions, including a Wikipedia
   article about diff [WIKIPEDIA], a blog post [VANROSSUM] by Guido van
   Rossum, and the documentation for GNU diffutils [GNU].

   At the same time, the HTTP PATCH method was recently standardized as
   RFC 5789 [RFC5789], for which this file format would be an ideal
   media type.  There are additionally other Internet-based services
   that trade regularly in patches or diffs that might benefit
   specifically from having participants explicitly declare that
   exchanged patchsets conform to a specific file format.

   Therefore, the goals of this document are first, to record a formal
   definition of the file format for reference purposes, and second, to
   request the IANA registration of a standard media type for this
   format.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  BNF

   Actual definition of the format.


3.  Acknowledgements

   The author wishes to thank those who have done the hard work of
   developing the algorithms and tools that form the de facto standard
   of patchset exchange on the Internet today.  In particular, he would
   like to recognize Douglas McIlroy and Larry Wall for the initial diff
   and patch utilities as well as the numerous contributors that have
   maintained and updated them over the years.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.


5.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
