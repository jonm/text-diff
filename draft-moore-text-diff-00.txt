Abstract

   This document captures the definition of the commonly-used "unified

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The "unified diff format" is a commonly-used file format typically
   used for exchanging patch changesets to a set of documents--most
   notably, source code trees. (including source code).  This format is
   generated and understood by a variety of open source tools including
   diff, patch, svn, and git.  However, at the time of this writing, no
   definitive, formal definition of this file format exists, although
   there are numerous informal definitions, including a Wikipedia
   article about diff [WIKIPEDIA], a blog post [VANROSSUM] by Guido van
   Rossum, and the documentation for GNU diffutils [GNU].

   At the same time, the HTTP PATCH method was recently standardized as
   RFC 5789 [RFC5789], for which this file format would be an ideal
   media type.  There are additionally other Internet-based services
   that trade regularly in patches or diffs that might benefit
   specifically from having participants explicitly declare that
   exchanged patchsets conform to a specific file format.

   Therefore, the goals of this document are first, to record a formal
   definition of the file format for reference purposes, and second, to
   request the IANA registration of a standard media type for this
   format.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Definition

   As a member of the "text/*" media type family, the text/diff format
   follows the requirements for textual messages laid out in RFC 2046
   [RFC2046], including the use of a "charset" parameter with a default
   value of US-ASCII and the use of CRLF as a linebreak.

2.1.  Permitted Character Sets

   As the unified diff format relies on the use of certain US-ASCII
   characters to delineate change hunks and context.  Therefore, the
   value of the "charset" parameter MUST reference a character set which
   is a superset of US-ASCII.  Permitted character sets specifically
   include:

   o  US-ASCII

   o  those in the ISO-8859-* family

   o  UTF-8

   Other character sets that are supersets of US-ASCII MAY be specified
   as values of the "charset" parameter.

   Generally speaking, this format is useful for describing changesets
   against files whose original and modified character set encodings are
   both supersets of US-ASCII.  Implementations generating text/diff
   SHOULD follow the guidelines of RFC 2046 [RFC2046] and use the
   "lowest common denominator" for the "charset" parameter value.  For
   example, it is possible that the original and modified versions of a
   file might use the ISO-8859-1 character set, but the changed portions
   may only use US-ASCII characters: in this case the resulting diff
   should be marked as using the "us-ascii" character set.

2.2.  Grammar

   A diff file begins with a two-line header describing the old and new
   filenames and their modification dates, and a way of differentiating
   which is which.


   filename = 1*VCHAR
   year = 4DIGIT
   month = 2DIGIT
   day = 2DIGIT
   date = year "-" month "-" day
   hour = 2DIGIT
   minute = 2DIGIT
   second = 2DIGIT
   nanosecond = 9DIGIT
   time = hour ":" minute ":" second
   timezone = ("+" / "-") hour minute
   file-modification = filename HTAB date SP time SP timezone
   old-indicator = "---"
   new-indicator = "+++"
   old-header = old-indicator SP file-modification
   new-header = new-indicator SP file-modification
   headers = old-header CRLF new-header CRLF

   of patchset exchange on the Internet today.  In particular, he would
   like to recognize Douglas McIlroy and Larry Wall for the initial diff
   and patch utilities as well as the numerous contributors that have
   maintained and updated them over the years.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.


5.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
