text-diff
=========

Documenting and registering the unified diff format as text/diff. Current
plan is to submit this as an Internet-Draft soon.

Note that the .xml version of the file is the definitive source; the .txt
version gets generated via xml2rfc, but I checked it in to facilitate getting
feedback.

Ok.
