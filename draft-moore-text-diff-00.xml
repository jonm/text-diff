      <t>The &quot;unified diff format&quot; is commonly used to

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The &quot;unified diff format&quot; is a commonly-used file
      format typically used for exchanging patch changesets to a set
      of documents--most notably, source code trees--or for comparing
      the contents of two distinct files.  This format is generated
      and understood by a variety of open source tools including diff,
      patch, svn, and git.  However, at the time of this writing, no
      definitive, formal definition of this file format exists,
      although there are numerous informal definitions,
      including <xref target="WIKIPEDIA">a Wikipedia article about
      diff</xref>, a <xref target="VANROSSUM">blog post</xref> by
      Guido van Rossum, and the <xref target="GNU">documentation for
      GNU diffutils</xref>.</t>

      <t>At the same time, the HTTP PATCH method has been standardized
      as <xref target="RFC5789">RFC 5789</xref>, for which this file
      format would be an ideal media type. There are additionally
      other Internet-based services that trade regularly in patches or
      diffs that might benefit specifically from having participants
      explicitly declare that exchanged patchsets conform to a
      specific file format.
      </t>

      <t>Therefore, the goals of this document are first, to record a
      formal definition of the file format for reference purposes, and
      second, to request the IANA registration of a standard media
      type for this format.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Definition">
      <t>As a member of the &quot;text/*&quot; media type family, the
	text/diff format follows the requirements for textual messages laid
	out in <xref target="RFC2046">RFC 2046</xref>, including the use
	of a &quot;charset&quot; parameter with a default value of US-ASCII
	and the use of CRLF as a linebreak.
      </t>
      <section title="Permitted Character Sets">
	<t>The unified diff format relies on the use of certain US-ASCII
	characters to delineate change hunks and context.
	Therefore, the value of the &quot;charset&quot; parameter MUST
	reference a character set which is a superset of US-ASCII. Permitted
	character sets specifically include:
	<list style="symbols">
	    <t>US-ASCII</t>
	    <t>those in the ISO-8859-* family</t>
	    <t>UTF-8</t>
	</list>
	Other character sets that are supersets of US-ASCII MAY be specified
	as values of the &quot;charset&quot; parameter. If the parameter
	is omitted then a default value of US-ASCII MAY be assumed.
	</t>
	<t>Generally speaking, this format is useful for describing
	changesets against files whose original and modified character
	set encodings are both supersets of US-ASCII. Implementations
	generating text/diff SHOULD follow the guidelines
	of <xref target="RFC2046">RFC 2046</xref> and use the
	&quot;lowest common denominator&quot; for the
	&quot;charset&quot; parameter value. For example, it is
	possible that the original and modified versions of a file
	might use the ISO-8859-1 character set, but the changed
	portions only use US-ASCII characters: in this case the
	resulting diff should be marked as using the &quot;us-ascii&quot;
	character set. An implementation MUST NOT include characters
	in a text/diff file that are not compatible with the value
	of the &quot;charset&quot; parameter.
        </t>
	<t>The requirement to have a single character set for a text/diff
        file means that there are certain change operations this format
        cannot express, for example the conversion of a file from
	ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 where non-US-ASCII characters are used in both
	the old and new versions. In particular, this means that not all
        output of the common UN*X diff utility--even when generating the
        unified diff format--will be a valid text/diff file. This media
        type is aimed instead at the very common case where the character
	sets of the old and new file are compatible with these requirements
	and can thus be treated as a text/* type.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Diff Contexts">
	<t>Diffs are typically generated from a specific context;
	  for example, from a specific directory on a file system,
	  or based against a particular version of a source control
	  repository.  Diffs are likewise applied against a specific
	  context, and often this context is different than the
	  generation context. For example, the diff may be applied
	  against a different directory on the same machine, or
	  against a directory on an entirely different filesystem,
	  or against a different branch of a codebase. Indeed, the
	  main purpose of diffs are to make a portable description
	  of a set of document changes.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The intended application context for diffs is carried
	  out-of-band from the diffs themselves in common usage, and
	  in fact is sometimes completely implicit, as with patchsets
	  sent on a developer mailing list for an open source project.
	  As such, this media type description will reference a
	  particular context without specifying it explicitly; instead,
	  a recipient fixes the context when attempting to apply the
	  diff to that context. Insofar as the same diff can be
	  applied to different contexts--albeit to varying degrees of success and to varying results--the meaning of the diff itself is not dependent
	  on a particular context.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For the remainder of this specification, we will assume that
	  this &quot;diff context&quot; can be specified as
	  a <xref target="RFC3986">URI</xref>.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Grammar">
	<t>Formal syntax in this document is governed by
	the <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form)
	notation</xref>, including the following core ABNF syntax
	rules defined by that specification: DIGIT (decimal digits),
	HTAB (horizontal tab), SP (space), CR (carriage return), and
	LF (linefeed). This syntax also incorporates by reference the
	&quot;URI-reference&quot; ABNF production
	from <xref target="RFC3986">RFC 3986</xref>.
	</t>
	<t>A &quot;diff file&quot; captures a set of instructions
	describing a particular set of document changes, often known
	as a &quot;patchset&quot; or a &quot;changeset&quot;. It consists
	of one or more &quot;document diffs&quot;, each document diff describing changes
	to a single document. A document diff consists of a &quot;header&quot;
	identifying the target document, usually relative to the overall diff
	context, plus one or more &quot;change hunks&quot; or &quot;chunks&quot;
	specifying additions, deletions, or edits of particular lines in the
	target document.

    <section anchor="security_considerations" title="Security Considerations">
      <section title="Out-of-scope attacks">
	<t>
	Since this document describes a media type and not a protocol,
	network-based attacks are out of scope for this specification.
	In particular, eavesdropping, replay, message insertion,
	deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle attacks are the
	concern of the containing or transporting protocol and not of
	the media type itself. This specification makes no claims
	about and does not provide facilities for authentication,
	authorization, file integrity, or non-repudiation.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="In-scope attacks">
      <t>As a subtype of the &quot;text/*&quot; media type, text/diff
	shares many of the security concerns related to processing any
	arbitrary text body.  In particular, implementators SHOULD be
	aware that this specification does not impose a maximum line
	length, and that implementations that assume a fixed maximum
	line length may be subject to buffer overrun attacks. Implementations
	should also be aware of denial-of-service or buffer overrun attacks
	involving extraordinarily large text/diff files. Again, however,
	file framing would be a concern of the containing or transporting
	protocol.
      </t>

      <t>In addition, text/diff files may contain control characters
	that may alter an operating environment when displayed to a
	terminal (or otherwise). <xref target="RFC3023">RFC 3023</xref>
	contains a list of possible attacks and recommended defenses
	against these attacks in its Security Considerations section.</t>
      
      <t>The contents of a text/diff file describe a set of changes
	that may be applied to a file to alter its contents, and hence
	implementations that process text/diff patches SHOULD be sure
	that the sender is properly authenticated and authorized
	before applying patches. To the extent that patches are
	automatically applied, recipients of text/diff entities may be
	at risk. In general, it may be possible to specify changesets
	that perform unauthorized file changes and/or make changes to
	the recipient's system that may affect subsequent processing.
      </t>

      <t>Some security considerations will vary by application domain.
	For example, text/diff patches intended to update financial
	records may have more stringent privacy, security, and auditing
	requirements than a publicly-disseminated file showing the
	source code differences between two releases of an open source
	software project.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
